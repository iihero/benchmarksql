    tpmC is the number of NEW_ORDER Transactions, that where processed
    per minute. This is often referred to as New Orders Per Minute (NOPM).
    A good benchmark result is one that achieves a high tpmC without
    violating any of the TPC-C response time or transaction mix
    constraints.

    <br/>
    A steady NOPM over the entire measurement period
    (0 .. {{ runinfo['runMins'] }} minutes in this run) is most desirable. 
    Any frequent or prolonged drops in tpmC are likely caused by spikes in
    the transaction latency.
