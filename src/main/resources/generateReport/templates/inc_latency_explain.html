    The total end-user experienced transaction latency is different from
    the database transaction latency. Since there is a limited number
    of database connections, a transaction submitted to the "System under Test"
    may not immediately start processing on the database because all
    connections are busy.

    BenchmarkSQL measures the total latency, experienced by the end-user,
    as well as the time, the
    request had to wait in the SUT for a database connection to become
    available. It is important to point out that increasing the number
    of database connections (parameter sutThreads) only helps to a certain
    point. That point is usually between two and eight times the number of
    CPU cores of the database server. After that point the concurrency in
    the database may increase the latency and cause the system to violate
    the response time constraints.
