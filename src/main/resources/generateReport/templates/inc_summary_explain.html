      <b>Warning: The transaction mix did not meet the TPC-C
      specifications! The minimum percentage for transactions

  <p>
    The TPC-C specification has a theoretical maximum of 12.86 NEW_ORDER
    transactions per minute per warehouse. In reality this value cannot
    be reached because it would require a perfect mix with 45% of NEW_ORDER
    transactions and a ZERO response time from the System under Test
    including the database.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above tpmC of {{ tpm_c }} is {{ tpm_percent }}% of that theoretical
    maximum for a database with {{ runinfo['runWarehouses'] }} warehouses.
